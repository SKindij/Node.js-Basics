# Creating HTTP server and client using Node.js HTTP module


HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
Node.js provides the http module to create an HTTP server and client.
To create an HTTP server using Node.js, we can use the createServer() method of the http module, which takes a callback function as an argument that is executed every time a request is made to the server.
The callback function takes two arguments: request and response, representing the incoming request and the response to be sent back to the client, respectively.
We can use the response object to send the response back to the client using methods like writeHead() and end().
To make an HTTP request using Node.js, we can use the http.request() method, which takes an options object as its argument that specifies the details of the request like the URL, headers, and request method.
We can handle the response using the response event and the data event to read the response data.
We can also use the http.get() method to make a simple HTTP GET request without having to specify the options object.
