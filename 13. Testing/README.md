# Unit and integration testing in Node.js

Testing is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring that your code functions correctly and reliably. In Node.js, you can perform two main types of testing: unit testing and integration testing. Let's explore these testing approaches, testing methodologies, and essential testing tools.

## Unit Testing

+ Unit testing involves writing automated tests for individual units of code in isolation, such as functions, classes, or methods.
+ Its primary goal is to verify that these units of code behave as expected.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- TDD is a development approach where tests are written before implementing the actual code.
- This ensures that the code meets the specified requirements and helps maintain code quality.

### Assertion Libraries

- Assertion libraries provide functions for making assertions about expected behavior in tests.
- Examples include the built-in `assert` library in Node.js or third-party libraries like `chai`.

## Integration Testing

+ Integration testing examines how different parts of the system work together, including interactions with external systems like databases, APIs, and other services.
+ It ensures that the integrated components function correctly as a whole.
