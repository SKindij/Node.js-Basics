# Spawning child processes in Node.js

A child process is a process that is created by another process, known as the parent process.

Node.js provides a built-in module called child_process for spawning child processes.

The spawn() method of the child_process module is used to spawn new child processes.

The spawn() method takes the command to run as its first argument, followed by an array of arguments to pass to the command.

The exec() method of the child_process module is used to run shell commands.

The execFile() method of the child_process module is used to run executable files.

Child processes communicate with their parent process using a message passing mechanism.

The send() method of the child_process module is used to send messages from a child process to its parent process.

The on() method of the process global object is used to listen for messages from child processes in the parent process.

Child processes can also communicate with each other using the fork() method of the child_process module, which creates a new child process that is a copy of the current process.

The fork() method returns a ChildProcess object that can be used to communicate with the forked child process.

The spawnSync() method of the child_process module can be used to synchronously spawn a child process and wait for it to exit.

The spawn() method of the child_process module can be used to asynchronously spawn a child process and listen for events related to the child process's lifecycle.
