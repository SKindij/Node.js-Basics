# Unit and integration testing in Node.js


Unit testing: Writing automated tests for individual units (functions, classes, etc.) of code in isolation.

Integration testing: Testing how different parts of the system work together, including communication with external systems (databases, APIs, etc.).

Test-driven development (TDD): A development approach where tests are written first, before the code is implemented, to ensure that the code meets the requirements.

Assertion libraries: Libraries that provide functions for making assertions about expected behavior in tests, such as the built-in assert library in Node.js or third-party libraries like chai.

Testing frameworks: Frameworks that provide a structure for organizing tests and running them, such as mocha or jest.

Mocking: Simulating external dependencies or behaviors in tests, such as using a library like sinon to create fake objects or functions.

Code coverage: Measuring how much of the code is being tested by the tests, often using tools like istanbul.

Continuous integration (CI): A development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed in a continuous cycle, often using tools like Jenkins or Travis CI.

Integration with other testing tools: Node.js integrates well with other testing tools and frameworks such as Selenium for automated browser testing, Puppeteer for headless browser testing, and Supertest for API testing.
