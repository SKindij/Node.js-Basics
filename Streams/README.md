# Implementing streams and piping in Node.js


Streams are a way to handle reading and writing data in Node.js applications. They allow you to process data in chunks as it is being read or written, which can be more memory-efficient than reading or writing entire files at once.

There are four types of streams in Node.js: readable, writable, duplex, and transform. Each type of stream serves a different purpose and can be used in different scenarios.

The fs module in Node.js provides several methods for creating and working with streams, including createReadStream and createWriteStream.

Piping is a technique for transferring data from one stream to another. You can pipe a readable stream to a writable stream, or even pipe multiple streams together to create a pipeline that performs a series of transformations on the data.

The pipe method is used to pipe data from one stream to another. It takes a destination stream as an argument and returns the destination stream, allowing you to chain multiple pipes together.

Error handling is important when working with streams. You can listen for errors on both readable and writable streams using the error event, and you can also use the on('data') method to detect errors in readable streams.

In addition to the built-in streams in Node.js, you can also create custom streams using the stream.Transform class. This allows you to implement custom transformations on data as it is being read or written.
