# Debugging Node.js applications using built-in and third-party tools


Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in software.

Node.js provides built-in debugging functionality through the --inspect flag and the Chrome Developer Tools.

The --inspect flag enables remote debugging using a debugger client like Chrome DevTools or Visual Studio Code.

To use the --inspect flag, you can start your Node.js application with node --inspect app.js.

The Chrome Developer Tools can be used to debug Node.js applications by navigating to chrome://inspect in the Chrome browser.

You can use the debugger statement in your code to set a breakpoint and pause the execution of your code at a certain point.

The console.log() method can be used to output messages to the console and help with debugging.

Third-party debugging tools for Node.js include Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, and Node Inspector.

In addition to traditional debugging, Node.js also supports profiling and memory monitoring to help identify performance issues.
